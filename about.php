                    <p>
                        Throughout history, before pens, computers, books and libraries, people have told each other stories. At KidsOut we understand that stories are really important and can help us understand each other, learn about other cultures, and help us celebrate our own. But most of all they are fun!
                    </p>

                        <p>World Stories is a growing collection of 152 traditional and original stories from around the world representing the 21 most commonly spoken languages by children in the UK. Currently one in seven UK children speaks a language other than English as their first language, often struggling to learn in an unfamiliar language and environment. World Stories is an online resource that helps children improve their literacy and keep up in the classroom. With more than 100 stories in written and audio format, World Stories opens the world to children.</p>

                        <P>Thanks to the wonderful support of writers, storytellers, translators, broadcasters and actors, these stories can be read, listened to and downloaded in English and their original language. We are continually working to add new stories, recordings and translations.
